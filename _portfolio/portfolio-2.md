title: "- Master’s Thesis — QM/MM calculations on the photochemical dynamics of LSSmOrange "
excerpt: "
<br/><strong>Duration:</strong> Sept 2023 – Jun 2024
<br/><strong> Supervisors:</strong>  Prof. Daniel Escudero, Prof. Jeremy Harvey 
<br/><strong>Institution:</strong> KU Leuven, Belgium
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Explored new flavors of electronic structure methods, photo-physics and excited-state dynamics to calculate the
excited state dynamics of LSSmOrange fluorescence protein by employing semi-empirical methods and a multi-scale
technique.
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Investigated surface-hopping behaviour of excited state proton transfer process of LSSmOrange."
