excerpt: "
<br/><strong>Duration:</strong> Dec 2021 â€“ Jun 2022
<br/><strong> Supervisor:</strong>  Prof. Feng Zheng 
<br/><strong>Institution:</strong> Tongji University, China
<br/>- Adopted machine learning method to indicate the significance of structures for rapid prediction of glass-transition
temperature of polyimides.
<br/>- Adapted 2D structural formulas into SMILES format and used online open libraries including RDkit to calculate the
values of molecular descriptors.
<br/>- Explored the applications of linear regression, random forest and artificial neural network in QSAR modelling."
