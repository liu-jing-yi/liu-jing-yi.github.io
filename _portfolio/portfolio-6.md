title: "- Synthesis of Polimide Ionogel for Memory Materials and Strain Sensor"
excerpt: "
<br/><strong>Duration:</strong> Mar 2020 â€“ Sept 2021
<br/><strong>Institution:</strong> Tongji University, China
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- National College Students Chemical Experiment Innovation Design Competition project.
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Synthesized a polymide ionogel maintaining both excellent mechanical and magnetic properties.
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Proposed a new method to embed nanoparticle ferroferric oxide into a new polymer framework. Attempted to show
the inner H-bond via fluorescent protein.
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Was awarded the First Prize of the 2nd National College Students Chemical Experiment 
Innovation Design Competition in both eastern china region and national finals."
