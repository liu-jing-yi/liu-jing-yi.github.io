title: "- Study of Isomerization Step of [P,O]-Chelated Nickel Catalysts"
excerpt: "<br/><strong>Published:</strong> January 28, 2025
<br/><strong>Duration:</strong> Oct 2024 – Present
<br/><strong>Supervisor:</strong> Prof. Xinglong Zhang
<br/><strong>Institution:</strong> The Chinese University of Hong Kong, China
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Assisted in the revision of a research article on the isomerization processes involved in nickel-catalyzed copolymerization of ethylene with polar monomers.
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Contributed to refining the study’s interpretation of DFT results, focusing on the mechanism and influence of auxiliary ligands on catalyst performance."
