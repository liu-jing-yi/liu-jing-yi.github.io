I am currently a Ph.D. student at the
[Department of Chemistry, the Chinese University of Hong Kong](https://chem.cuhk.edu.hk), 
under the supervision of
[Prof. Xinglong Zhang](https://xinglong-zhang.github.io). Recently, my interests focus on exploring
the intersection of data-driven approaches and quantum chemistry, particularly in:
- **Development of automation tools for computational chemistry**
- **Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) for catalytic systems**
- **Accelerating high-accuracy dynamics for biomolecular systems**

Iâ€™m keen to bridge rigorous computational chemistry with cutting-edge ML techniques
to expand the scope of tractable problems.

My fascination with computational chemistry started back 
at [Tongji University](https://en.tongji.edu.cn/p/#/), playing with molecular descriptors. 
This led me to the prestigious [EM-TCCM program](https://www.emtccm.org) for a Master's Degree,
issued by [KU Leuven](https://www.kuleuven.be/english/kuleuven). 
During this time, I have the opportunity to be supervised by [Prof. Jeremy Harvey](https://jeremyharveygroup.wordpress.com) 
and [Prof. Daniel Escudero](https://danielescuderomasa.wixsite.com/website). My thesis entitled "QM/MM Calculations 
on the Photochemistry of LSSmOrange Fluorescent Protein", where I explored the excited states properties of large 
biomolecular systems. To know more about my previous research experiences, please see [here](/portfolio/).
