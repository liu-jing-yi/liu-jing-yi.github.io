I am currently a Ph.D. student at the [Department of Chemistry](https://chem.cuhk.edu.hk), 
the Chinese University of Hong Kong, under the supervision of
[Prof. Xinglong Zhang](https://xinglong-zhang.github.io). Recently, my interest lies in exploring
the intersection of data-driven approaches and quantum chemistry, particularly in:
- **Development of automation tools for computational chemistry**
- **Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) for catalytic systems**
- **Accelerating high-accuracy dynamics for biomolecular systems**

Iâ€™m keen to bridge rigorous computational chemistry with cutting-edge ML techniques
to expand the scope of tractable problems.

Prior to that, I obtained my Master's Degree from the prestigious [EM-TCCM program](https://www.emtccm.org) at 
[KU Leuven](https://www.kuleuven.be/english/kuleuven), 
where I have the opportunity to be supervised by [Prof. Jeremy Harvey](https://jeremyharveygroup.wordpress.com) 
and [Prof. Daniel Escudero](https://danielescuderomasa.wixsite.com/website). My thesis entitled "QM/MM Calculations 
on the Photochemistry of LSSmOrange Fluorescent Protein", where I explored the excited states properties of large 
biomolecular systems. To know more about my previous research experiences, please see [here](/portfolio/).
